My Mayan food. Blog
</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:tomato;">
The ancient Mayan people were incredible chefs and many of their have stood the test of time. They lived of the land and used the vegetables that grew around their cites in creative ways. Food played an extremely important role in their culture and they believed that some ingredients were gifts sent to them by the gods. An example of this is…
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="font-family:verdana;color:yellow;">
Chocolate
</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:goldenrod;">
Cacao is endemic to the lands of the Maya, who were the first to take the seeds of the fruit and roast them to make hot chocolate. The ancient Maya didn’t make candy bars, nor did they add sugar and milk to the cacao. Instead they took their chocolate as a ceremonial elixir and a savory mood enhancer. For the Maya, cacao was a sacred gift of the gods, and cacao beans were used as currency. Ek Chuah, the Maya god of merchants and trade, was also the patron of the cacao crop. When the Spanish invaded Maya lands in the 1500s, they adopted the beverage, adding sugar and milk to make it sweet and creamy.<br><br>
In addition to that<br><br>
</h2>
<h1 style="font-family:verdana;color:tomato;">
Avocados and Guacamole
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:yellow;">
The avocado, originating in southern Mexico and Guatemala, is loved for its rich taste and creamy texture and was a treasured crop of the ancient Maya. Even today a person from Antigua Guatemala is called a panza verde, or green belly, because of the region's reliance on avocados in hard times.Combined with chilis, garlic, cilantro, onions, and lime or lemon, avocados become guacamole, a sumptuous appetizer. Don’t expect to find lots of Hass avocados in the Maya world—there are many other varieties, most of which are bigger<br><br>
One last example is<br><br>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;color:yellow;">
coffee
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:goldenrod;">
Seeing where your coffee comes from is an eye-opening experience. The typical coffee plantation tour includes a visit to fields (and often an explanation about the virtues of shade-grown coffee), continues to areas where the beans are dried and processed, and ends with a cup of café. Finca Filadelfia, with views of distant volcanoes, offers tours near Antigua Guatemala.<br><br>

Majestic Machu picchu
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:tomato;">
Every professional or amateur traveler has always wanted to set foot in the renowned Machu Picchu. And how not to do it? With the most outstanding and wonderful views of a lost city of the Incas. All this added to the mysteries that surround this complex, it is understandable to want to visit and experience it. Thanks to our many years of offering private and personalized tours, we know how confusing it can be for tourists to explore the Wonder of the World. That is why together with Machu Travel Peru we have decided to prepare a travel guide so that you can know everything about how to visit Machu Picchu. In this way, on your next visit to the citadel, you will find yourself more familiar with the route. Get ready to enjoy one of the most important attractions in Peru!<br><br>
In general, if you want to visit Machu Picchu, the complex is available all year round. But it must be taken into account that its climate is divided into two very marked seasons that usually coincide with the tourist seasons. For example, from October to April the rainy season runs and normally coincides with the low tourist season. While the dry season runs from May to September and this coincides with the high season for tourism. Keep in mind that the Peruvian weather is very unpredictable, so the best time to go to Machu Picchu will depend a lot on your taste and availability. If you are one of those who likes quiet visits and without so many people around, the low season may be ideal for you. Even if you are planning to enjoy a honeymoon in Machu Picchu, it is best to organize your trip away from the high season. If you choose to stay in Aguas Calientes, you will have the option of arriving much earlier than all the influx of tourists.<br><br>

10 facts about Macchu pichu
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:tomato;">
10. In the Quechua Indian language, “Machu Picchu” means “Old Peak” or “Old Mountain.”<br><br>
9. Machu Picchu is made up of more than 150 buildings ranging from baths and houses to temples and sanctuaries<br><br>
8. The compound contains more than 100 separate flights of stairs. Most of the individual staircases were carved from one slab of stone.<br><br>
7. Although many of the stones that were used to build the city were more than 50 pounds, it is believed that no wheels were used to transport these rocks up the mountain. Rather, it is thought that hundreds of men pushed the heavy rocks up the steep mountainside.<br><br>
6. Many different theories exist about Machu Picchu’s purpose—a royal estate and a secret ceremonial center among them.<br><br>
5. The Incas were some of the best masons in the world. The structures were so well built with a technique called ashlar (stones that are cut to fit together without mortar) that not even a knife blade can fit in between stones.<br><br>
4. Machu Picchu was only known locally until Yale Professor Hiram Bingham re-discovered the site in 1911. His book, The Lost City of the Incas, was based on his findings.<br><br>
3. A long-standing dispute between Peru and Yale University has existed over the artifacts collected by Bingham during his exploration of the site. Yale maintains that they own the items while Peru insists they were given on loan.<br><br>
2. Machu Picchu was an astronomical observatory, and its sacred Intihuatana stone accurately indicates the two equinoxes. Twice a year, the sun sits directly over the stone creating no shadow.<br><br>
1. Unfortunately, most cities built by the Inca civilization were destroyed by the Spanish conquest. Machu Picchu was in a hidden location—invisible from below—and not found, making it one of the most well-preserved Inca cities and an archeological gem.<br>

Wonder 7: casual Christ the redeemer

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:tomato;">
1. Christ the Redeemer was built using reinforced concrete and has an outer shell of 6 million soapstone tiles. It’s believed that the workers who made these tiles occasionally wrote notes on the back, meaning this iconic landmark is full of hidden messages.<br><br>
2. Due to the statue’s mountaintop position, it’s prone to lightning strikes and gets hit around three to six times a year. Prior to the FIFA World Cup in 2014, lightning struck and broke one of the statue’s thumbs.<br><br>
3. The original design of the statue was different to what we see today. It was intended for Christ to be holding a globe in one hand and a cross in the other, rather than two open arms.<br><br>
4. Christ the Redeemer was not actually built in Brazil. It was first made in France by French sculptor Paul Landowski who created the statue in clay pieces. These were then shipped to Brazil to be remade with reinforced concrete by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and French engineer Albert Caquot.<br><br>
5. Construction of the statue took 9 years. Beginning in 1922, it was finally finished in 1931 at a cost of $250,000 US.<br><br>
6. The statue boasts an impressive title. In 2007 it was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World alongside top sights such as the Great Wall of China, Machu Picchu and the Rose City of Petra.<br><br>
7. It’s one of the largest statues of Jesus and the tallest art deco statue in the world. Christ the Redeemer reaches a height of 30 metres and boasts an arm span of 28 metres.<br><br>
8. Housing prices in Rio de Janeiro have increased simply if the property has a view of Christ the Redeemer. Apartments with even a slight view of the statue are higher than those with the same location and size but no view.<br><br>
9. The light-coloured stone used to build the statue was taken from a quarry near the city of Ouro Preto. However, this stone is in short supply and restoration works are having to be done using different types. As a result, stone in a darker shade is slowly replacing the original, meaning Christ the Redeemer is gradually getting darker.<br><br>
10. Each year, Christ the Redeemer is visited by nearly 2 million people. The record number of visitors to the statue in a single day was a huge 14,000 during Easter of 2011.<br><br>
